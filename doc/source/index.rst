   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

This is the yt attic.
=====================

This is a repository of yt analysis modules that have fallen by the
wayside.  Some have not been updated to stay current with yt
development and some may not be working correctly.  If you would like
to revive anything in here and/or incorporate into your own software
packages, please do!  Also, consider listing your code on the
`yt Extensions page <http://yt-project.org/extensions.html>`__.

-------------------------

The yt Attic repository can be found `here
<https://github.com/yt-project/yt_attic>`__.  In order to work
